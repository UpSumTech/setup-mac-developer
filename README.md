## Setup Mac Developer

This repo is used to set up a development environment. It has recently been tested with Catalina.
This project is not backwards compatible and does not support older versions of Mac OS.

I pretty much work on it as and when i need to setup a new dev machine. So there could be months between bug fixes.

### Pre-requisites
There are a few pre-res for Catalina

1. To allow the terminal to be able to change dirs etc on mac
   some of which could be owned by root, you need to provide "Full Disk Access" to terminal and iterm2 in the "Privacy" settings.
